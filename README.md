# Text classification
Text classification is a task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing text into predefined categories or classes. This task is important in many applications such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic modeling, and more.

The text classification process usually consists of several steps, including data preparation, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Data preparation involves collecting and preprocessing the text data, which includes tasks such as cleaning, normalization, and tokenization. Feature extraction involves converting the text into a numerical representation that can be used as input for a machine learning model. Common techniques for feature extraction include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.

Once the data has been prepared and features have been extracted, a machine learning model is trained on a labeled dataset. Common models used for text classification include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

After training the model, it is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for text classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
